Commented code, needs to be ported and re-enabled:
	AssemblyParserService
	ParseProjectContent
	ProjectContentRegistryDescriptor
	Ambiences
	Tooltips (DebuggerService.GetText)
	DefinitionViewPad
	Class Browser (removed from source tree; to be reimplemented using WPF)
	NRefactoryLanguageConverter
	Context Actions (EditorContext etc.)
	RefactoringService
	FindReferencesAndRenameHelper
	NamespaceRefactoringsService
	RefactoringMenuBuilder
	TaskService.UpdateCommentTags

Stuff that was renamed/moved:
	ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.Dom -> the type system and resolvers now are part of ICSharpCode.NRefactory
	IDocument, ITextEditor -> moved to ICSharpCode.Editor assembly
	IClass -> ITypeDefinition
	ParseInformation -> IParsedFile
	ICompilationUnit -> IParsedFile
	ITextBuffer -> ITextSource (in ICSharpCode.Editor assembly)
	IReturnType -> ITypeReference (unresolved) or IType (resolved)
	Location -> TextLocation or AstLocation. Use AstLocation only when directly working with the AST, and TextLocation otherwise.
	TextLocation -> moved to ICSharpCode.Editor assembly
