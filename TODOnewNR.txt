Commented code, needs to be ported and re-enabled:
	ParseProjectContent
	Class Browser (removed from source tree; to be reimplemented using WPF)
	NRefactoryLanguageConverter
	Context Actions (EditorContext etc.)
	RefactoringService
	FindReferencesAndRenameHelper
	NamespaceRefactoringService
	RefactoringMenuBuilder
	TaskService.UpdateCommentTags
	CodeManipulation.cs (btw, I think this doesn't belong into AvalonEdit.AddIn - more a job for a language binding)

--> See TODO-list on Google Docs

Stuff that was renamed/moved:
	ICSharpCode.SharpDevelop.Dom -> the type system and resolvers now are part of ICSharpCode.NRefactory
	IDocument -> moved to ICSharpCode.NRefactory.Editor
	IClass -> ITypeDefinition
	ICompilationUnit -> IParsedFile
	ITextBuffer -> ITextSource (in ICSharpCode.NRefactory.Editor)
	IReturnType -> ITypeReference (unresolved) or IType (resolved)
	Location -> TextLocation in ICSharpCode.NRefactory
	TextLocation -> moved to ICSharpCode.NRefactory

Functionality changes:
	The result of a parser run (ParseInformation) now may contain a fully parsed AST.
	The ParserService may cache such full ASTs, but may also drop them from memory at any time.
	This will be implemented by keeping the last N accessed files in the cache. (currently we just keep the caches around forever)
	Every parse information also contains an IParsedFile instance with the type system information.
	The IParsedFile is stored permanently (both in ParserService and in the IProjectContents).


Context Actions vs. Member Context Menu:
	Members context menu should include refactoring options that can be applied from the outside,
	for example in the classes pad when the code file isn't open.
	Refactorings that don't make sense without opening the file shouldn't be in the member menu.
	
	The context actions menu should show all refactorings (even those that are also in the members context menu).
