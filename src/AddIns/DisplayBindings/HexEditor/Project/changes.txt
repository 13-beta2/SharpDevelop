Known bugs/Problems:

1) When in overwrite mode you have to type into the text display
(right hand side) twice before the value is changed.
2) Might be good to be able to change individual hex parts of a byte.
3) Might be good if the next hex value to be typed in was highlighted
in the hex display.
4) Seems to be a slight delay with moving the blinking highlight as
you use the keyboard to move around the editor.
5) Maybe the cursor position should just highlight the text and not blink?
6) Copy and paste does not seem to work. The wrong data is copied.
This could be because the Copy menu item is not enabled.
7) When you paste in insert mode the text/hex is inserted. Should it
not replace the selected text/hex?
