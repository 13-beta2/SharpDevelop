Debugger.Core and Debugger.Interop are the two libraries that hold most core debugging functionality. 

The vast majority of the code of these libraries was written by me without any modifications made by other people. If you could preserve this ratio by not making any modifications, I would be extremely pleased and I would be indebted to you.

However, if you find a bug or if you have an idea or suggestion, please do send me an e-mail to dsrbecky@gmail.com

Thank you very much, David Srbecky
