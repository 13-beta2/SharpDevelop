How foldings work:
	The FoldingManager maintains a list of foldings. The FoldMargin displays those foldings and provides
	the UI for collapsing/expanding.
	Folded foldings cause the FoldingElementGenerator to produce a line element that spans the whole folded
	text section, causing the text generation for the visual line that contains the folding start to
	continue after the folding end in another line.
	To ensure scrolling works correctly in the presence of foldings, lines inside folded regions must not
	be used as start lines for the visual line generation. This is done by setting the line height of all
	such lines to 0. To efficiently set the height on a large number of lines and support reverting to the
	old height when the folding is uncollapsed, a CollapsedLineSection is used.
